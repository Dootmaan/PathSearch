# Note: these are placeholders discovered by scanning PathSearch. To make the project
# portable, either provide these files at the same relative locations or update the
# scripts to point to local paths or use environment variables. Some of these may be
# generated during preprocessing (e.g., caches); others are likely external datasets
# or checkpoints that cannot be committed to the repo.
